### Team Members: Gian, V
### Client: Gian, V
### Date: 11/14/2024



## 1. App Idea
Our game is a holiday-themed take on the classic Simon Says memory game. Players follow and repeat a sequence of flashing ornaments on a Christmas tree, which light up in a specific order. With each successful round, the sequence becomes progressively longer and more complex, challenging the player's memory. The goal is to keep up with the pattern of glowing ornaments and reach the highest score possible.

## 2. Target Audience
This game is designed for players of all ages, but it specifically targets children and families looking for a fun, holiday-themed activity. The ideal age group is 6–12 years old, but the game is also suitable for teens and adults who enjoy memory challenges. With simple mechanics and festive visuals, the game caters to both casual gamers and families seeking an easy-to-learn, engaging experience. 

## 3. Goals and Vision
The client’s goals for the game are to create a festive and engaging holiday experience that is accessible to a wide audience, particularly families and children. The game will capture the joy of the Christmas season through a fun, memory-based game that players can enjoy together.



## 4. Key Features

- Single-player mode with increasing difficulty: Players will progress through rounds of sequences that become longer and more complex.
- Pattern-based gameplay: Players follow and replicate sequences of flashing     Christmas tree ornaments, with each level adding one more ornament to the sequence.
- Festive visuals and sound effects: A Christmas tree decorated with vibrant, clickable ornaments, accompanied by holiday-themed sound effects when ornaments light up.
- Score tracking and high score display: Players’ scores increase with each successfully completed round, and high scores are saved to encourage replayability.
- Holiday-themed achievements: Unlockable achievements, such as "5 Sequences Matched," "Memory Master," and "Holiday Champ," to encourage goal-oriented gameplay.
- User-friendly interface: Simple, intuitive design that is accessible for players of all ages, with large, easy-to-tap ornaments.
- Responsive design: The game will be optimized for both mobile and tablet screens to reach a broader audience.
- Background music and mute option: Festive background music with the option to mute sounds, so players can customize their experience.


## 5. Success Criteria
The game will be successful if it delivers a festive, bug-free experience that engages the target audience, encourages repeat play, and meets the client’s goals for holiday-themed brand engagement.



## 6. Technical Requirements
The game will be developed for any device that has a browser and should run smoothly at a minimum of 20 frames per second. It will use simple tap controls for selecting and repeating ornament sequences, and will require responsive design to adapt to various screen sizes. The game should use minimal storage and memory to ensure compatibility with most mobile devices, with an option to save high scores and achievements locally.
